This is my C++ project on a Taxi Dispatch System, the Dispatcher gets given the amount of people travelling and it gets sorted into an if else statement to determine which vehicles are best suited for the amount of people
then it gets sorted to which drivers can drive the chosen vehicle, with 3 options of licenses, B, D, D1
